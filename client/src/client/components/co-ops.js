						<h4>CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM </h4>
							<p>This is Victoria’s Work-Ready Talent Advantage. But what is it?
								Co-operative Education (co-op) is a work experience program that gives post-secondary students the opportunity to apply their academic learning through regular, real-world work terms throughout their undergraduate degree. We achieve this by integrating work into every student’s learning, something we call Work-Integrated Learning Model (WIL). Work-Integrated Learning is a model and process of curricular experiential education which formally and intentionally integrates a student’s academic studies within a workplace or practice setting. WIL experiences include an engaged partnership of at least: an academic institution, a host organization and a student. WIL can occur at the course or program level and includes the development of learning outcomes related to employability, personal agency and life-long learning.
								Forget everything you thought you knew about student internships. Our Co-op program adds up to almost three years of work experience to your résumé. With access to a big network of Co-op jobs around the country, you’ll be able to try out exciting careers and build a world-class professional network.
